Todo:
	- Change all devices to DropBox only for DayOne
	- Add project to github	
	- Edit project file so it ignores sublime workspace
	- Can I make it save the worksapce in an out dir? @question
	- Make a planning dir and put taskpaper in it
	- Test via Rake and then build via rake in project file
	Research:
		- How do I find out the document type used by mdfind for Day One tasks?
		- Is there a Ruby lib for Day One?
		- What's the Ruby Lib for bridging to AppleScript?
